Compliance: OSHA 1910.300-series, CSA Z462-23, NFPA 70E 2024

1. Hazard-Specific Controls
Electrical Shock Prevention

Voltage Thresholds:
50V AC/100V DC: Mandatory PPE + GFCIs

600V: Prohibited approach boundary enforcement


Lockout Verification:
Test voltage detector on known live source
Verify circuit de-energization
Re-test detector on live source

Arc Flash Mitigation

Incident Energy Protocols:
<1.2 cal/cm²: Category 0 PPE
1.2–4 cal/cm²: Category 1+
4 cal/cm²: Engineered controls required


Boundary Distances (IEEE 1584):
Flash Protection Boundary = √(53 × kVA × 0.01) meters

Arc Blast Protection

Mandatory Pre-Work Actions:
Vibration analysis on bus joints
Infrared scan for thermal faults
Pressure venting verification for switchgear

2. Critical Procedures
Zero-Energy Verification
plain

STEP 1: System shutdown (OSHA 1910.333(b)(2))  
STEP 2: Position isolators OFF/OPEN + lock per LOTO-UTL-2024  
STEP 3: Test all phases at point-of-work  
STEP 4: Apply grounds for capacitve loads  
Applies to all circuits >50V

Energized Work Authorization
When Permitted:


Diagnostics <5 minutes at >600V

Infeasibility of de-energization (OSHA 1910.333(a)(1))
Requirements:

Site-Specific Work Plan

Incident energy analysis calculation

Real-time remote supervision via GCC

3. PPE Requirements Hierarchy
Incident Energy (cal/cm²) | Protection System


0–1.2 | CAT 0: FR shirt/pants + voltage gloves + safety glasses

1.2–4 | CAT 1: + Flash hood + hearing protection

4–8 | CAT 2: + Arc suit (8 cal) + balaclava

8–25 | CAT 3: + Multi-layer suit + respirator

25 | CAT 4: Max. coverage suit + SCBA


Glove Selection (ASTM D120):


Class 00: <=500V (1-min test)

Class 2: <=17kV

Class 4: <=36kV

4. Compliance Rules
Worker Classification
Qualified Person:


Documentation of 4,000+ hours in electrical role

Annual hands-on emergency drill certification
Unqualified Person:

Strict prohibition within limited approach boundary
(<25kV: 1.92m, >25kV: space + 0.1m/kV adjustment)

Testing Instruments:

Field-calibrated per IEEE 510 monthly

Dual-channel verification systems for >300V

Safety rating matching circuit voltage

5. Emergency Response
Electrical Contact Protocol:


DO NOT TOUCH victim

De-energize via GCC emergency disconnect (Code RED)

Apply rubber glove rescue if >600V (trained responders only)

CPR within 3 minutes for cardiac arrest

Arc Event First Aid:


COOL burns: 25°C water flush (minimum 15 min)

NO creams/lotions

Monitor for airway swelling

6. Compliance Controls
Documentation:


Pre-work JHA + arc flash labels per NFPA 70E 130.5

GCC Permit BG-UTL-2024 for all grounding

Daily equipment inspection logs

Training:


Initial: 72-hour technical course

Annual:
24-hour refresher
Live-dead-live testing drills
PPE donning/doffing

Enforcement:

Immediate work stoppage for:


Missing voltage verification

Incorrect PPE per incident energy

Lockouts applied without OFF/OPEN verification

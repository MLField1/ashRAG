
Date: 2023-11-20 | Doc ID: MAD-SAFETY-001

Purpose
To establish safe working distances from energized electrical equipment to prevent injury from arc flash, electric shock, or electrocution.

Scope
Applies to all personnel working on or near energized electrical systems (AC/DC) rated 50V or higher , including:

Substations, switchgear, transformers, overhead/underground lines.
Maintenance, testing, or troubleshooting activities.
Definitions
Minimum Approach Distance (MAD): The closest distance a worker may approach an energized conductor or component without proper PPE or insulation.
Qualified Person: Trained and authorized personnel per OSHA/NFPA 70E standards.
Arc Flash Boundary: Distance at which incident energy from an arc flash drops to 1.2 cal/cm² (risk of second-degree burns).
Key Factors Determining MAD
Voltage Level
Equipment Type (e.g., open-air lines vs. enclosed switchgear)
Working Position (e.g., horizontal vs. vertical access)
Environmental Conditions (e.g., humidity, dust, conductive contaminants)

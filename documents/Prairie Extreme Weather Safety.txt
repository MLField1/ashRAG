Compliance Standards:


CSA Z1000-14 Occupational Health & Safety

Environment Canada Wind Chill Index

Alberta OHS Code Part 16: Heat & Cold Stress

1. Extreme Temperature Thresholds
Heat Stress Activation:


Start protocols at 28°C when wearing PPE or 32°C without PPE

Full activation at 40°C (all activities restricted)
Cold Stress Activation:

Initiate protocols at -20°C with wind chill factor

Critical activation at -40°C (emergency operations only)

2. Prairie-Specific Work Scheduling
Summer Protocols (35°C to 40°C):


Primary work window: 0500-1000

Restricted activities: 1000-1800 (shaded/critical tasks only)

Evening operations: Light duties after 1900

Hydration: 300mL electrolyte solution every 20 minutes

Winter Protocols (-30°C to -40°C):


-30 to -40°C: Maximum 15-minute exposure intervals

Below -40°C: Work cessation except life-critical repairs

Mandatory heated vehicle on-site at all times

3. Protective Systems
-40°C Clothing System:


Layer 1: Moisture-wicking thermal base (silk or polypropylene)

Layer 2: Heavy fleece insulation (400 grams per square meter)

Layer 3: Insulated flame-resistant overalls

Layer 4: Windproof parka (CSA Class 3A, rated to -50°C)

Accessories: Balaclava + neoprene face mask

+40°C Cooling System:


Phase Change Material vest (replaceable ice packs)

Evaporative cooling neck gaiter

Hard hat with 10+ cm brim attachment

Ultraviolet-protective sleeves (CSA certified)

4. Equipment Requirements
Winterization (-40°C):


Vehicles require engine block heaters below -25°C
年 Must use Arctic-grade diesel fuel (anti-gel formulation)

Tools must use cold-rated steel (prevent brittle fracture)

Battery-powered equipment requires thermal blankets

Heat Mitigation (+40°C):


Insulated tool handles (prevent contact burns)

Cooled storage for electronic equipment

Reflective vehicle/trailer surfaces

5. Health Monitoring
Cold Exposure Limits:


-25 to -30°C: 30-minute maximum exposure (warm breaks every 15 min)

-31 to -39°C: 20-minute maximum exposure (buddy system mandatory)

-40°C and below: 10-minute maximum exposure (medical standby required)

Heat Stress Prevention:


Continuous core temperature monitoring (wearable sensors)

Mandatory 30-minute AC recovery if core reaches 38.5°C

6. Emergency Protocols
Whiteout Conditions:


Travel prohibited when visibility <400m at -25°C

Survival kits must include:
Insulated shelter tent (-40°C rated)
Chemical warmers (6+ hour duration)

Extreme Heat Events:


Cooling stations within 300m of work areas

Ice immersion kits for heat stroke treatment

7. Prohibited Activities
Below -35°C Restrictions:


Climbing steel structures

Exposing skin >2 minutes

Solo work beyond 500m from vehicle

Above 38°C Restrictions:


Confined space entry

Flame-resistant gear without active cooling

Asphalt operations between 1100-1900

8. Training Requirements
Specialized Modules:


Frostbite recognition (-30°C simulation)

Heat collapse response (40°C environment training)

Whiteout navigation (GPS/compass proficiency)
Certifications:

Red Cross Advanced Wilderness First Aid

CSA-approved extreme weather competency

9. Unique Prairie Conditions
Chinook Wind Protocol:

For rapid temperature increases (+20°C/+hr):


Monitor for thermal shock symptoms

Adjust hydration and PPE within 15 minutes

Cardiac screening for at-risk workers

10. Communication Standards
Winter Communications (-40°C):


Satellite phones with cold-rated batteries

Glove-compatible keypads

Redundant notification systems

Summer Communications (+40°C):


Explosion-proof UHF radios

Solar-resistant casings

Emergency alerts via multiple channels

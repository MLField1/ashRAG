IEEE 1584: Guide for Performing Arc-Flash Hazard Calculations

1. Hazard Risk Category (HRC) Classification
(HRC = Numeric level indicating arc-flash risk severity)


HRC 0

Incident Energy: ≤1.2 cal/cm²

Tasks: Voltage testing <50V, panel observations

Required Clothing: Certified FR or 100% cotton clothing

Minimum ATPV: N/A


HRC 1

Incident Energy: ≥4 cal/cm²

Tasks: Circuit breaker operation <240V

Required Clothing: Single-layer FR (4.5-5 oz/yd² weight)

Minimum ATPV: 5 cal/cm²


HRC 2

Incident Energy: ≥8 cal/cm²

Tasks: MCC maintenance, 480V switching

Required Clothing: Medium-weight FR + balaclava

Minimum ATPV: 8 cal/cm²


HRC 3

Incident Energy: ≥25 cal/cm²

Tasks: >5kV equipment work, substation racking

Required Clothing: Multi-layer FR system + flash hood

Minimum ATPV: 25 cal/cm²


HRC 4

Incident Energy: ≥40 cal/cm²

Tasks: Transmission line >15kV, high-fault zones

Required Clothing: Heavyweight FR suit + face shield

Minimum ATPV: 40 cal/cm²


2. Material Specifications
(ATPV = Arc Thermal Performance Value)

(cal/cm² = calories per square centimeter)

Material - FR Cotton

Weight - 4.5-5.0 oz/yd²

ATPV Range - 5-6 cal/cm²

HRC Suitability - HRC 1

Material - Modacrylic Blend

Weight - 6.0-7.0 oz/yd²

ATPV Range - 8-12 cal/cm²

HRC Suitability - HRC 2

Material - ARAMID Blends

Weight - 8.0+ oz/yd²

ATPV Range - 25-40 cal/cm²

HRC Suitability - HRC 3-4

3. Layering Rules

Prohibited: Synthetic/non-FR underlayers (polyester, nylon)

Required Layering: FR-only base layers

Protection Bonus: Double layers provide 120% higher ATPV
Example: 5 cal single layer → 11 cal when doubled

4. Mandatory Components

All HRCs:
• Arc-rated hard hat (ANSI Z89.1)
• UV-protection safety glasses

HRC 2+:
• Leather glove protectors
• EH-rated boots

HRC 3+:
• Voltage-rated insulated tools
• Rubber matting

HRC 4:
• Full-face air-purifying respirator

5. Abbreviations Key

ATPV: Arc Thermal Performance Value - Burning prevention rating

HRC: Hazard Risk Category - Protection level (0-4)

NFPA: National Fire Protection Association

ASTM: American Society for Testing and Materials

cal/cm²: Calories per square centimeter - Incident energy measurement

EH: Electrical Hazard rating for footwear

6. Critical Requirements & Corrections

Scenario: Using HRC 2 gear for 15kV breaker work
Correction: Upgrade to ARAMID blend HRC 3 system

Scenario: Synthetic shirt under FR coveralls
Correction: Replace with FR-certified base layer

Scenario: Faded FR labels/unverifiable gear
Correction: Immediately remove from service

7. Certification Checks

Required garment labels:
✓ Current ATPV/E₅₀ rating
✓ NFPA 70E compliance statement
✓ Manufacture date within 5 years
✓ Flame-test certification to ASTM F1891

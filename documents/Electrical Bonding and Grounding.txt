1. Definitions and Applications
When to GROUND:


De-energized equipment over 50V

Capacitor banks after discharge

Mobile generators exceeding 600V

Temporary systems without permanent grounding

When to BOND:


Exposed conductive parts (conduit, enclosures, racks)

Multiple work locations at same voltage potential

Creating equipotential zones for worker protection

2. Grounding Protocol (5-Step Process)

Verify De-energization

Use CAT IV 1000V-rated voltage tester
Test phase-phase and phase-ground

Establish Grounding Cluster

Position grounds within 1 meter of work area
Use triangular formation for multi-phase systems

Apply Grounds

Sequence: Ground point → Grounded conductor → Phases
Secure hooks on clean bare metal

Secure Connections

Torque clamps to 50 N·m minimum
Use thermite welding where vibration occurs

Verify Continuity

Confirm resistance under 1 ohm
Measure with calibrated microhmmeter

Electrically Safe Zone:


Extends 0.6 meters from grounded equipment

Zero voltage verified before entry

3. Bonding Protocol for Equipotential Zones
Applications:


Steel lattice structures

Multiple metallic platforms

Conductive work surfaces above 300V

Procedure:


Use 2/0 AWG minimum copper cables

Cross-bond adjoining conductive elements

Measure under 25 milliohms resistance

Maintain bonds until work completion

4. Equipment Requirements
Grounding Sets:


Minimum rating: 40kA for 0.25 seconds

Pass inspection if:
Undamaged ferrules and clamps
No strand damage exceeding 10%

Fail if:
Thermal discoloration present
Cracks in connection points

Clamps:


Cold weather rated (-50°C minimum)

Must achieve bare metal contact

5. Protection Zone Specifications

Ground mat resistance maximum: 0.15 ohms

Voltage gradient test: 0 volts confirmed

Personal protective boundary: 0.6 meter radius

Ground clusters visible from work position

6. Strict Prohibitions
Grounding Prohibitions:


Grounding downstream of disconnects

Single-ground protection for systems over 600V

Using equipment grounds for bonding

Bonding Prohibitions:


Bonding different voltage systems

Exceeding manufacturer's cable length limits

7. Documentation Requirements
Field Checklist:


Grounding diagram sketched and verified

Cluster resistance tested and recorded (value in ohms)

Equipotential bonds continuity confirmed

Personal voltage detector used

Sign-off: Lead Electrical Worker signature and credentials

Record Retention: 3 years minimum

8. Special Conditions
Capacitive Circuits:


Ground for longer than 4 time constants (RC)

Test residual voltage under 50V
High Voltage Transmission (over 115kV):

Install gradient control mats

Use multi-point grounding strategy
Cold Weather Operations:

Preheat clamps below -30°C

Remove ice from contact surfaces

Use bare-hand technique only when justified

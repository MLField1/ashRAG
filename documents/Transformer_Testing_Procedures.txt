1. Purpose
This document outlines standardized procedures for testing power transformers in electrical utility environments. The goal is to ensure operational reliability, detect potential faults, and maintain regulatory compliance.

2. Scope
Applies to all maintenance personnel, field engineers, and testing contractors involved in the commissioning, routine maintenance, and diagnostic testing of distribution and power transformers.

3. Safety Precautions
- All testing personnel must wear appropriate PPE including arc-rated clothing, gloves, and face shields.
- Confirm de-energization and grounding of the transformer before testing.
- Use lockout/tagout (LOTO) procedures to isolate the transformer.
- Verify test equipment calibration and insulation integrity before use.

4. Types of Transformer Tests

4.1 Insulation Resistance Test
- Purpose: Assess insulation condition between windings and ground.
- Equipment: Megohmmeter (500V to 5kV).
- Procedure: Disconnect transformer from service, apply test voltage, record resistance values.
- Acceptance Criteria: Typically >100 MΩ depending on voltage class.

4.2 Turns Ratio Test (TTR)
- Purpose: Verify correct winding ratios and detect shorted turns.
- Equipment: Transformer Turns Ratio Tester.
- Procedure: Connect test leads to primary and secondary windings, apply low voltage, measure ratio.
- Acceptance Criteria: Within ±0.5% of nameplate ratio.

4.3 Power Factor (Tan Delta) Test
- Purpose: Evaluate insulation aging and moisture content.
- Equipment: Power Factor Test Set.
- Procedure: Apply test voltage to winding, measure power factor and capacitance.
- Acceptance Criteria: <1% for new transformers; trending used for in-service units.

4.4 Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA)
- Purpose: Detect internal arcing, overheating, and insulation breakdown.
- Equipment: Gas Chromatograph (lab-based).
- Procedure: Extract oil sample, analyze for key gases (H2, CH4, C2H2, etc.).
- Interpretation: Use Duval Triangle or Rogers Ratio for fault diagnosis.

4.5 Sweep Frequency Response Analysis (SFRA)
- Purpose: Detect mechanical displacement of windings.
- Equipment: SFRA Analyzer.
- Procedure: Inject frequency sweep, compare response to baseline.
- Acceptance Criteria: Deviations indicate mechanical deformation.

4.6 Oil Quality Tests
- Purpose: Assess dielectric strength, moisture, and acidity of insulating oil.
- Tests: Dielectric Breakdown Voltage, Water Content (Karl Fischer), Acid Number.
- Frequency: Annually or after fault events.

5. Test Procedures

5.1 Pre-Test Checklist
- Review transformer nameplate and previous test records.
- Confirm test equipment calibration.
- Isolate and ground transformer.
- Notify control center and obtain work permits.

5.2 Test Execution
- Follow manufacturer and IEEE/IEC standards for each test.
- Record ambient temperature and humidity.
- Perform tests in sequence to avoid re-energization between tests.

5.3 Post-Test Activities
- Remove grounds and restore transformer to service.
- Analyze test results and compare with historical data.
- Flag anomalies for engineering review.

6. Equipment Required
- Megohmmeter
- TTR Tester
- Power Factor Test Set
- Oil Sampling Kit
- SFRA Analyzer
- Infrared Thermography Camera (optional)
- PPE and grounding equipment

7. Documentation
- Use standardized test forms or digital test sheets.
- Include test date, personnel, equipment serial numbers, and environmental conditions.
- Archive results in asset management system.
- Generate exception reports for abnormal findings.

8. Training and Competency
- Personnel must be certified in transformer testing procedures.
- Annual refresher training required.
- Hands-on training with test equipment mandatory for new hires.

J. Protective Relay ANSI Codes
(IEEE C37.2 Standard)

41. 50 - Instantaneous Overcurrent (lightning/bolted fault)

42. 51 - Time Overcurrent (coordination for faults)

50/51 - Combined instantaneous + time OC relay

43. 27 - Undervoltage (loss of voltage protection)

44. 59 - Overvoltage (surge/capacitor bank failure)

45. 86 - Lockout Relay (initiates lockout after trip)

46. 87 - Differential (internal faults: transformers/buses)

87T = Transformer Differential | 87B = Bus Differential

47. 25 - Synchronism Check (reclose verification)

48. 32 - Directional Power (anti-motoring for generators)

49. 67 - Directional Overcurrent (fault direction sensing)

50. 79 - Autoreclose (auto line restoration)

51. 85 - Carrier/Pilot Relay (communication-based protection)

Usage Example:


GCC permits require disabling ANSI 79 before repairs. After LOTO, verify ANSI 86 is asserted and ANSI 50/51 settings match prints.


Key Updates to Previous Sections:

Added SAF in Safety Procedures:
57. SAF - Switchgear Arc Flash (incident energy >40 cal/cm² protocol)

Modified SCADA definition:
58. SCADA - Includes relay status monitoring (ANSI codes 87/50/27)

Field Notes for Relay Codes:


Life-Critical References:
86 = Must verify lockout state before LOTO (EIP Permits)
27/59 = Pre-verification for capacitor work (BG-UTL-2024)

Code Combinations:

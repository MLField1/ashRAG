Compliance Standards:


CSA Z1002-19 Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment

ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health and Safety

OSHA 1910.132 Hazard Assessment

1. Pre-Work Assessment Timeline
Deadlines:


Team assessments completed on-site before first task

Individual valid: 1 shift (max 12 hours)

Supervisor validation: Required for high-risk work
Methodology:

Site walk-through + task review

3-Step System: Identify → Analyze → Control

2. Mandatory Assessment Components
Environmental Hazards Check:


Temperature: Current ______ °C (Alert if >32°C or <-25°C)

Wind: Speed ______ km/h (Stop work >60 km/h)

Precipitation: [ ] Rain [ ] Ice [ ] Snow Depth ______ cm

Visibility: ______ m (Minimum 150m for mobile equipment)

Site-Specific Hazards:


Overhead: [ ] Powerlines ‖ Clearance ______ m

Underground: [ ] Marked utilities [ ] Unverified zones

Terrain: [ ] Slopes >30° [ ] Trenches [ ] Unstable ground

Human Factors:


Fatigue level: [ ] Alert [ ] Moderate [ ] High (mandatory rest if high)

Crew competence: [ ] Fully trained [ ] New hire supervision required

3. Risk Scoring Matrix (P x S = R)**
Probability (P):

1: Improbable (<1%)

2: Possible (1-20%)

3: Likely (21-75%)

4: Certain (>75%)

Severity (S):

1: Minor injury (first aid)

2: Medical treatment

3: Major injury (lost time)

4: Fatality

Risk (R) Action Thresholds:


Green (1-4): Proceed

Yellow (5-8): Implement controls

Red (>9): Stop work

4. High-Probability Utility Hazards
Electrical:


Arc flash risk [ ] Present ATPV ______ cal/cm²

Unverified isolation [ ] LOTO complete [ ] Required
Fall Risks:

Height >1.2m without guardrail [ ] Yes [ ] No

Roof work pitch >15° [ ] Present
Environmental:

Confined space entry [ ] Planned ATP ______ ppm

Wildlife activity [ ] Recent sightings [ ] No

5. Control Implementation Hierarchy

Elimination: Remove hazard completely

Substitution: Use safer method/equipment

Engineering: Barriers/guards/ventilation

Administrative: Training/procedures

PPE: Final protective layer

Mandatory Documentation:


Control measures selected: ________________

Backup control if primary fails: ____________

6. Sign-Off Protocol
Signatories:


Lead worker (print): ______________

Spotter/Safety Watch: ______________

Supervisor (electronic approval): ______________
Details Required:


Time: ________

GPS: 51.0447° N, 114.0719° W

Re-assessment trigger: Conditions change | Break >2hr

7. Critical Stop Work Triggers
Immediately Halt Operations If:


Unplanned energy source encounter

Weather exceeds safe limits

Hazard controls compromised

PPE becomes ineffective

Rescue access blocked

8. Assessment Records Retention

Digital copy: Upload within 2 hours

Hard copy: Field copy in weatherproof case

Storage: 7 years minimum

Audit frequency: Quarterly random checks

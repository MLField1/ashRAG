1. Purpose
This document outlines the standard procedures for testing and maintaining circuit breakers in electrical utility environments. The goal is to ensure operational reliability, safety, and compliance with regulatory standards.

2. Scope
Applies to all medium and high-voltage circuit breakers used in substations, switchyards, and industrial facilities. Includes air, vacuum, SF6, and oil circuit breakers.

3. Safety Precautions
- De-energize and isolate the breaker before testing.
- Follow lockout/tagout (LOTO) procedures.
- Use appropriate PPE including arc-rated clothing, gloves, and face shields.
- Verify absence of voltage using approved test equipment.
- Ensure test equipment is properly grounded.

4. Types of Circuit Breakers
- Air Circuit Breakers (ACB)
- Vacuum Circuit Breakers (VCB)
- SF6 Gas Circuit Breakers
- Oil Circuit Breakers

5. Types of Tests
5.1 Insulation Resistance Test
- Measures insulation integrity between phases and to ground.

5.2 Contact Resistance Test
- Evaluates the resistance across closed contacts to detect wear or contamination.

5.3 Timing Test
- Measures opening and closing times of breaker contacts.

5.4 Mechanical Operation Test
- Verifies mechanical integrity and operation of the breaker mechanism.

5.5 SF6 Gas Analysis (for SF6 breakers)
- Checks gas pressure, moisture content, and purity.

6. Test Procedures
6.1 Insulation Resistance Test
- Use a 5kV or 10kV megohmmeter.
- Disconnect control wiring.
- Measure phase-to-phase and phase-to-ground resistance.
- Acceptable values typically >1000 MΩ.

6.2 Contact Resistance Test
- Use a micro-ohmmeter (100A or higher).
- Connect leads across breaker contacts.
- Record resistance; typical values <100 µΩ.

6.3 Timing Test
- Use a breaker analyzer.
- Connect sensors to trip and close coils.
- Record open/close times and compare with manufacturer specs.

6.4 Mechanical Operation Test
- Manually or electrically operate the breaker.
- Observe for smooth operation, unusual noise, or binding.
- Lubricate moving parts as needed.

6.5 SF6 Gas Analysis
- Use a gas analyzer.
- Sample gas from breaker tank.
- Record pressure, moisture (ppm), and SF6 purity (%).

7. Equipment Required
- Digital insulation resistance tester
- Micro-ohmmeter
- Circuit breaker analyzer
- SF6 gas analyzer
- Torque wrench and hand tools
- PPE and grounding equipment

8. Documentation
- Record all test results in maintenance logs.
- Include date, technician name, equipment ID, and test values.
- Note any corrective actions taken.
- Maintain records for regulatory compliance and trend analysis.

9. Training
- Personnel must be trained in high-voltage safety and test equipment use.
- Refresher training required every 2 years.
- Only qualified technicians may perform testing on energized systems.

Compliance Standards:


OSHA 1910 General Duty Clause

ANSI Z358.1 Monitoring Systems

CSA Z1000 Solo Worker Guidelines

1. Scope & Definitions
Designated Solo Work:


Tasks with mitigated hazards (e.g., meter reading, inspections)

Prohibited: High-risk activities (confined space, >6 ft elevation)
Unintentional Solo Work:

Unexpected separation from crew >100 ft for >15 min

Requires immediate supervisor notification

2. Mandatory Communication Protocol
Interval Requirements:


Check-ins every 30 minutes (high-risk zones)

Check-ins every 60 minutes (low-risk remote areas)
Methods (Hierarchy):


Two-way SATCOM with GPS (ATEX-rated)

Cellular-linked push-to-talk apps

Manual check-in logs
Failure Response:


Missed check-in → Alarm triggered at dispatch

No response after 5 min → Dispatch rescue/Locate GPS

3. Hazard-Specific Controls
Electrical Work:


Voltage Limit: ≤240V (no live work >50V alone)

Requirement: Infrared camera inspection before approach
Field Vehicle Operations:

Stuck Vehicle Protocol:
• Attempt self-recovery ≤10 min
• Activate SOS beacon if immobilized
Wildlife Threat Areas:

Mandatory Gear: Bear spray + air horn

Restriction: No solo work dusk-dawn in bear country

4. Monitoring Equipment Standards
Type A - Body-Worn:


Passing: Dual-mode cellular/satellite

Failing: Single-communication units
Type B - Vehicle-Mounted:

Passing: Automated engine-stop detection + tilt sensors

Failing: Manual-only alert systems
Technical Requirements:

Operating Temp: -40°C to +55°C

Battery Life: ≥12 hours continual

Certification: IP68 waterproof / SIL2 functional safety

5. Prohibited Solo Activities
Absolute Restrictions:


Confined space entry

Transmission tower climbing

Hazardous voltage testing (>50V)

Chemical handling (transformers, SF6)
Conditional Allowances:
✅ Ground-level substation rounds WITH:

Live video feed to control center

Man-down sensors activated

6. Emergency Response Protocol
Alarm Activation Thresholds:


Man-down detection (impact + no motion): Auto-alert

Ambient air quality hazard: Auto-alert

Blood pressure emergency: Manual trigger
Rescue Timing:

Urban Areas: Response ≤15 minutes

Remote Areas: Response ≤60 minutes with GPS coordinates

7. Training & Mock Drills
Initial Training:


8-hour classroom: Risk recognition, tech use

Field Simulation: Simulated emergency response
Annual Requirements:

Tech competency test

Solo scenario drill (abandoned vehicle simulation)
Docs: ANSI-compliant training record (JD number appended)

8. Critical Abbreviations

SIL2: Safety Integrity Level 2 (monitoring reliability standard)

ATEX: Hazardous Atmosphere Equipment Certification

SATCOM: Satellite Communication

LEL: Lower Explosive Limit

OSHA: Occupational Safety and Health Administration

9. Violations & Corrections
Critical Failure:


Worker performing transformer oil sampling alone
Correction:


Immediate work stoppage

Mandatory 24-hour suspension

Retraining verification

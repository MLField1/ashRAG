Compliance Standards:


OSHA 1910.146 (Permit-Required Confined Spaces)

ANSI Z117.1 Safety Requirements

NIOSH Publication 80-106

1. Confined Space Identification
Defining Characteristics:


Limited entry/exit points

Not designed for continuous occupancy

Potential atmospheric hazards
Common Utility Examples:

Transformers >50 kVA

Manholes >4 ft deep

Combustion turbine housings

Sewer lift stations

Stormwater vaults

2. Classification System
Non-Permit Space:


Criteria: No atmospheric hazards, no engulfment risk

Example: Clean dry transformer vaults
Permit-Required Space:

Class A: Immediately Dangerous to Life/Health (IDLH)

Class B: Potential hazardous atmosphere

Class C: Engulfment/configuration hazards

3. Atmospheric Testing Protocol (Pre-Entry)
Testing Sequence:


Oxygen: 19.5%-23.5%

LEL: <10% lower explosive limit

Toxins:
CO < 25 ppm
H₂S < 10 ppm
Equipment:


Calibrated 4-gas meter (bump-tested daily)

Remote samplers with 10 ft probe
Fail Response:

Immediate evacuation if:
• O₂ <19.5% or >23.5%
• LEL >10%
• H₂S >15 ppm

4. Ventilation Requirements
Mechanical Ventilation:


Mandatory for Permit Spaces

Rate: Minimum 20 air changes/hour

Position: Supply fresh air near entrants
Prohibited:

Oxygen enrichment (>23.5%)

Recirculating ventilation systems

5. Entry Permit Components
Mandatory Fields:


Space ID (e.g., "Manhole #37-B")

Entry purpose/duration

Atmospheric test results

Attendant(s) and entrant(s) names

Rescue service contact
Validity Period:

Normal: 8 hours max

IDLH: 15 minutes (emergency entry only)

6. Rescue Equipment
Minimum Configuration:


Tripod with mechanical winch (1,500 lb capacity)

Full-body harness with dorsal attachment

Air-supply respirators (30-minute bottles)

Spinal board with head immobilizer
Location:

Within 25 ft of entry point

Rescuer accessibility <10 seconds

7. Prohibited Practices
Extreme-Risk Violations:


Testing atmospheres with flame safety lamps

Entering Class A spaces without SCBA

Ventilation using vehicle exhaust

Solo entries (always 2+ person team)

8. Training Requirements
Initial Certification:


24 hours classroom/practical training

Mock rescue scenarios
Refresher Training:

Annual 8-hour update

Equipment drills every 90 days
Records:

Certificates valid 3 years

Agency: ANSI Z117.1 accredited provider

9. Critical Abbreviations

LEL: Lower Explosive Limit

IDLH: Immediately Dangerous to Life/Health

SCBA: Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus

PPM: Parts Per Million

OSHA: Occupational Safety and Health Administration

NIOSH: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health

10. Rescue Alert Matrix
plain

Situation: Atmospheric Failure  
1. Sound evacuation alarm  
2. Activate ventilation  
3. Deploy retrieval system  

Situation: Entrant Unresponsive  
1. Verify space status  
2. Rescue team entry with SCBA  
3. Stabilize on spinal board

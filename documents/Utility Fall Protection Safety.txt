Compliance Standards:


OSHA 1926 Subpart M

ANSI Z359 Fall Protection Code

IEEE 1307 Utility Specific Requirements

1. Fall Hazard Classifications
Pole/Tower Work:


Height Threshold: >4 ft above ground

Required System: PFAS + dual lanyards
Aerial Devices:

Height Threshold: Any elevated position

Required System: Bucket restraints + body belt
Transmission Structures:

Height Threshold: All work above 6 ft

Required System: Horizontal lifeline + shock-absorbing lanyard

2. Personal Fall Arrest System (PFAS) Requirements
Harness:


Type: ANSI Z359.11 full-body harness

Pass Criteria: D-rings intact, webbing free of cuts/abrasions

Fail Criteria: Frayed webbing, distorted hardware, chemical exposure
Lanyards:

Type: Shock-absorbing, 6 ft max length

Pass: Energy absorber packed, 100% webbing integrity

Fail: Deployed absorber, signs of impact loading

3. Anchor Point Specifications
Wood Poles:


Strength Requirement: 5,000 lb capacity

Acceptable: Crossarm brace, pole band anchors

Prohibited: Nail cleats alone
Steel Structures:

Strength Requirement: 100 kN tested

Acceptable: Certified davit arms, structural beams

Prohibited: Pipe rails, unrated equipment

4. Clearance Calculations
Critical Formula:

Total Fall Distance = Lanyard Length + Deceleration Distance + Safety Factor + Worker Height

Minimum Clearance:


Bucket Trucks: 2 ft below boom

Lattice Towers: 12.5 ft (with shock absorber)

5. Equipment Inspection Protocol
Daily Checks (Worker):


Pass Criteria: Stitching intact, labels legible, snaps lock

Fail Actions: Remove from service immediately if signs of damage
Certified Inspection (Q6 months):

Pass Criteria: Documentation, load testing verification

Fail Criteria: Evidence of UV degradation

Required Stamp: ANSI Z359.2 compliant inspection tag

6. Rescue Requirements
Response Time:


Mandatory: Rescue within 5 minutes of fall event
Equipment:

Location: Rescue kits within 300 ft of elevated work

Contents: Biolite 4:1 pulley (or equivalent), stretcher, trauma straps

7. Training & Certification
Annual Requirements:


Practical: Transfer techniques on live structures

Classroom: OSHA 1926 Subpart M refresher
Certification:

Documentation: ANSI Z359.2 trainer certification

Renewal: 3 year intervals

8. Critical Failure Scenarios
High-Risk Violations:


Error: Using positioning lanyard as fall arrest

Correction: Replace with dual-certified shock-absorbing lanyard

Error: Anchor below dorsal D-ring

Correction: Anchor always at/shoulder level
